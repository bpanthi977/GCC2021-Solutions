* Global Coding Challenge 2021

[[https://www.credit-suisse.com/pwp/hr/en/codingchallenge/#/][Organized by Credit Suisse]]

This repo contains all the problems of the competition and solutions to them submitted by bpanthi977. 

Note that some of the `main` function of the solutions don't take input from stdin. i.e. I didn't clean them up, and left them as used while debugging. 

* Acknowledgment
+ Markdown files of the problems were taken from [[https://github.com/CeereeC/Credit-Suisse-GCC2021][CeereeC]]'s repo.
